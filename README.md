Welcome by FlameOS, A Python coded operating system.
You just run os.py but if your packages is not installed,
Or your os.py or updater.py or both are missing, You just run build.py.
That will build the whole OS for you again, Make sure you have access to internet on a update or build!

Greetings from Viren Sahti, The developer of FlameOS!
